# Themes: End of Life (Community Contributed)
Community Contributed Gallery 2 Themes deemed to be broken are placed here.

These are typically themes tied to external services or products that are no longer available.

Themes can only be added to this folder by the project team but developers can update these themes and make pull requests. 

If a theme currently placed here is fixed, it will be moved to another folder reflecting the updated status.
