# Modules: End of Life (Officially Contributed)
Officially Contributed Gallery 2 Modules deemed to be broken are placed here.

These are typically modules tied to external services or products that are no longer available.

Modules can only be added to this folder by the project team but developers can update these modules and make pull requests. 

If a module currently placed here is fixed, it will be moved to another folder reflecting the updated status.
